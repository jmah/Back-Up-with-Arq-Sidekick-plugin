# "Back Up with Arq" Sidekick Plugin

This is a plugin for [Sidekick](http://oomphalot.com/sidekick/), a cool "do *[things]* when I open my laptop at *[place]*" app, that simply triggers an [Arq](http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/) backup. That's about it â€” no options, no fuss.

Back Up with Arq was created by Jonathon Mah. Props to the good guys at Oomph.
